Day #3: (13/07/2022):

#1 Completed the project and attempted a different approach too but not sure about its effectivity. There are separate files for each approaches

Filenames:

Approach 1: Original Approach

This is the original approach as showed in the reference video of making the prediction model.

Approach 2: Tried with 'Close Price' values instead of converting it to 'Returns' 

Second approach to the model in which predicting 'returns' is replaced with predicting actual 'close price' and the calculation of 'returns' is eliminated.

PS: The dataset here has been replaced with Sensex (^BSESN) which is Indian stock market index for both the approaches
